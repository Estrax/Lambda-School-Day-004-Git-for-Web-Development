# Hey, I am Lukasz...

...and I am:
- indecisive
- wet blanket
- full of hot air

I am going to talk about a hobby I extremely enjoy no mather where I am. I will even tell you what the hobby is, how long I have been doing it and why it is important to me.

My hobby is... doing nothing for a long time! It may sound strange, but I really enjoy wasting my time on doing nothing meaningful. It is one of the activities I do a lot.

I do it all the time since I was born! I even decided to pursue my career in it and become the Doing-Nothing-Master. I expected to fully enjoy doing it by myself. No matter where I am, there is always nothing to do near me.

It is really important to me because it makes me wasting the time I do not have and do not do the thing I really need to do. It has helped me to achieve nothing!

I hope you all have activities that you enjoy doing in your spare (or even work) time!
